# Video Streaming Fixes for PigeonSocial

## Overview
Fixed broken video functionality in posts by implementing proper WebTorrent streaming based on the working patterns from `wt.js`.

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Complex and unreliable video initialization** - The original VideoPlayer had overly complex logic with forced peer discovery and metadata handling
2. **Inefficient streaming methods** - Was trying multiple fallback methods without proper prioritization
3. **Poor torrent management** - Torrents weren't being created with proper options for streaming
4. **Memory leaks** - Blob URLs weren't being properly cleaned up

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified VideoPlayer.tsx
- **Removed complex torrent manipulation** - No more forced peer discovery, metadata forcing, or manual tracker announcements
- **Streamlined streaming methods** with clear priority:
  1. WebTorrent's built-in server (fastest)
  2. renderTo method (WebTorrent Desktop compatibility)
  3. getBlobURL (for smaller files)
  4. Manual streaming with progressive loading (fallback)
- **Better error handling** with meaningful error messages
- **Proper cleanup** of blob URLs to prevent memory leaks
- **Improved timeout handling** (30 seconds instead of 10)

### 2. Enhanced pigeonSocial.ts Service

#### createVideoTorrent method:
- **Added proper torrent options** including trackers for better peer discovery
- **Immediate torrent storage** for faster access
- **Better logging** for debugging
- **Timeout handling** to prevent hanging

#### addTorrentForPost method:
- **Added tracker configuration** for better peer discovery
- **Enhanced event handlers** for ready, metadata, download progress, and errors
- **Better error recovery** - automatically removes failed torrents
- **Improved logging** for debugging torrent state

### 3. Based on Working wt.js Patterns
The fixes are based on the working server implementation in `wt.js` which showed:
- Proper HTTP range request handling
- Reliable torrent seeding
- Built-in WebTorrent server usage
- Clean error handling

## Key Improvements

### Performance
- Videos should load faster due to better tracker configuration
- Progressive loading for larger files
- Proper use of WebTorrent's built-in streaming server

### Reliability
- Better error handling with automatic cleanup
- Timeout protection against stuck torrents
- Simplified logic reduces failure points

### User Experience
- Clear loading states
- Meaningful error messages
- Better video controls
- Memory leak prevention

## Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a post with a video file
3. Check that:
   - Video torrent is created successfully
   - Video loads and displays properly
   - Controls work (play/pause, volume, fullscreen)
   - No memory leaks occur
   - Error states are handled gracefully

## Browser Console Debugging
The implementation includes extensive logging with emoji prefixes:
- üé• Video initialization
- üîó Magnet URI handling
- üåä Torrent/streaming operations
- ‚úÖ Success states
- ‚ùå Error states
- üìπ Torrent-specific operations

## Architecture Notes
The solution maintains the existing peer-to-peer architecture while fixing the streaming reliability. Videos are still distributed via WebTorrent, but with much more reliable loading and playback mechanisms based on the proven patterns from the working `wt.js` implementation.
